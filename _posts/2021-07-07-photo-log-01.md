#### The human brain is the greatest general-purpose hardware created by evolution. The hardware evolves very slowly if at all, but the software is a marvel, constantly undergoing development. It's all quite amazing

In my last two years of photography, I've had a fascination with humans and how we interact with our surroundings. I sometimes wonder if we are living independently in our own simulation or sandbox if you will, similarly to a virtual machine running on a host computer, not much data escapes the virtual machines designated memory space. Humans have invented various languages and techniques of communication, but they are all just an attempt to share our ideas and our unique interpretation of a somewhat shared experience.

If my perception of the world is unique because of the conditions and programs running in my own little virtual machine universe, then this means I have a world of creative opportunity as I go around photographing places and faces. This thinking has greatly impacted my relationship with the way I make photographs, I've photographed the mundane, everything from people going about everyday life on the streets of Toronto (with many missed left hooks and angry seniors of course). I've photographed the enormous amounts of trash people leave behind in weird places around the city. Somewhere in the mix I also made at least a few photos of the cities most popular landmark, the CN tower!<!--more-->

All that to say I got very comfortable making photos in urban places, the faces of strangers draw my attention as I roam around the city hoping to find the next moment to photograph. I find lots of freedom in shooting on the street where I always have the option to blend in or stand out. I can immerse myself in a scene moving very swiftly to distract the humans around me. It's a very bizarre dance I must imagine when observed by a bystander. Nevertheless, it allows me to make poetry in a split second of noticing perfect store-front signage with the right face walking by. it's all quite intoxicating at times, but I digress.

On my recent 10,000 km plus road trip around Canada, I found out how narrow of a perspective I had on photography. As I explored Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Colombia I found that although I was encountering lots of new and interesting scenery, I was unable to capture the emotion these places created in me. How could I be an effective photographer if I could not translate my emotions into images? This same camera that had become an extension of my body did not feel right.

As I explored life in other parts of Canada, not only did I hit a creative block, I also found that I wasn't very interested in the travel photography genre, the beautiful scenery in Alberta and BC were just beautiful, not beautiful in a way that caused me to think deeply, not in a way that warranted any further interrogation. But as a photographer, I still had the need to translate my emotions into photographs. It was not just a want, it was a need. I needed to prove something to myself I guess. Towards the end of my road trip, I really started to understand myself as an artist, I really began to think about what elements prompted my attention.

The camera is my tool, it allows me to interrogate the surroundings looking for clues. I don't think these clues are leading anywhere specific, but they keep me on my toes, they give my imagination a workout... Anyway, I think I've found yet another style of photography that I enjoy.

Here are some photos I made in the past week while out walking. All of these were taken on my phone oddly enough. I'm sure I'll have more to say on this topic very soon, but for now here are some of my musings.

Enjoy ‚úåüèΩ
