<h4>The human brain is the greatest general-purpose hardware created by evolution. The hardware evolves very slowly if at all, but the software is a marvel, undergoing minute by minute development. It's all quite amazing</h4>

In my last two years of photography, I've had a fascination with humans and how we interact with our surroundings. I sometimes think if we are all living independently in our own simulations, then that means my interaction and perception of the world around me are unique to me. This thinking has greatly impacted my relationship with the way I make photographs. I've photographed everything from people on the streets of Toronto (with many missed left hooks and angry seniors of course). I've photographed the enormous amounts of trash people leave behind in weird places around the city. Somewhere in the mix, I've also made at least a few photos of the cities most popular landmark, the CN tower!

All that to say I got very comfortable <!--more-->making photos in urban places, the faces of strangers draw my attention as I roam around the city hoping to find the next moment to photograph. I find lots of freedom in shooting on the street where I always have the option to blend in or stand out. I can immerse myself in a scene moving very swiftly to distract the humans around. It's a very bizarre dance I must imagine when observed by a bystander, but nevertheless, it allows me to make poetry in a split second of noticing perfect store-front signage with the right face walking by. it's all quite intoxicating at times, but I digress.

On my recent 10,000 km plus road trip around Canada, I found out how narrow of a perspective I had on photography. As I explored Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Colombia I found that although I was encountering lots of new and interesting scenery, I was unable to capture the emotion they created in me. This same camera that had become an extension of my body did not feel right. I went from shooting in such a fast-paced environment where nailing focus with a manual lens was an act of magic, to a much slower way of working.

As I explored life in other parts of Canada, not only did I hit a creative block, but I also found I'm not very interested in the obvious travel photography, the beautiful scenery in Alberta and BC were just beautiful, not beautiful in a way that caused me to think deeply, not in a way that warranted any further interrogation. Towards the end of my road trip, I really started to understand myself as a photographer, as an artist, I really began to think about what draws me to this medium of photography.

The camera is my tool, it allows me to interrogate the surroundings looking for clues. I don't think these clues are leading anywhere specific, but they keep me on my toes, they give my imagination a workout... Anyway, I think I've found yet another style of photography that I enjoy.

Here are some photos I made in the past week while out walking. All of these were taken on my phone oddly enough.
