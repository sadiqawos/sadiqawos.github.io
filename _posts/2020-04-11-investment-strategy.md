It's been a long time coming. I grew up with my parents inductrinating me with the idea that I need to be very smart with my money. They always openely talked about the invetments that they were making, both for themselves, and even for myself and siblings. The disconnect came when I was in my teens, after years of talking about investing, they still had not achieved financial indenpendence. They still complained about money and this just made no sense to me. I started to wonder if my own financial security would have to come soley and practically from just working hard and making a lot of money all at once. Emphasis on "all at once", more on this later.

Looking forward a few years. I've been in my carrer for just over 7 years now and I still haven't made a shit-ton of money. I'm still workinghard and growing my experties and hope to soon reach the level of mastery. I'm still a few years away from my 10,000 hours required to develop my mastery in the thing that makes me money (tech), but as I get closer to mastery, I've become more efficient at my learning. I've become more purposefull with going after the things that get me closer to my professional goals. I digress, this level of mastery has made me more confident, and I'm finally letting myself get distracted by other skills I believe are going to be essential for the future of the legacy I'm building.

Coming back to the purpose this post, I still believe very strongly that my financial independence will eventually come from my hard work and dedication to my craft, but I've also broadend my horizons by picking up the financial strategies preached by the likes of the greatest investors the world has ever seen. Value investing, Dividend investing, using the money I already have, no matter how small to make more money. Letting the money work for me in the mean time as I navigate the space and time between where we are and where I know I'll be in the future.

Like many, I was inundated by the examples of people in my life who've invested in mutual funds, stocks and bonds with very little to show for over a long period of time, or even worse, people without a lot of knowledge on finance given emotional driven opinions on decisions they've made. Not for any fault of thier own, but just for a lack of access to good education. I digres, although I hold myself subseptible to the same inductrinations that make most humans resnetfull of the markets, I have a higher than average ability to be good at things I put my mind to. I have the intuitivness that i've now spent years developing. Going back to the 10,000 hours rule. The skills I've mastered so far have all lent themselves to other aspects of my life. Natually having a scientific and engineering background to life, I've learnt to question the why, and then question the why of the why! I've rearnt that multiple solutions to a singular answer exist by simply being open to possibility of the aformentioned solutions existence. Some kind of make belife stuff honestly.

**My strategy so far**
1. Find companies that have a cult like following
2. Find companies that pay good dividends
3. Never invest in a business you cannot understand
4. Reinvest everything
